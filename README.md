# plattfot-app

This is original a small school project. It is written in Java, thus using JavaFX for the GUI-elements.
The project is using the design pattern called MVC. 
For database I am using Sqlite. And I have not used SQL scripts to create tables, but I am doing it programatically. With help of JDBC.
